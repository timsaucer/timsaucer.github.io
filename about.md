No, the avatar doesn't look anything like me. It's my 9 year old friend's depiction of what I would look like if I was cool.

I'm an AI Engineer by day and a role playing gamer by night.

I'm currently running [Decent Into Avernus](https://timsaucer.github.io/avernus) for a group of 5th graders.

I also run [Camp Quest Michigan](https://www.michigancampquest.org) one week out of the summer.
