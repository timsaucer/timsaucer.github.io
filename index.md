I don't have much content to add yet. I'm currently working on setting up
[Obsidian.md](http://www.obsidian.md) to track my notes for a D&D campaign
I'm running of [Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia). This is set up as a
[GitHub](http://www.github.com) repository that will automatically generate a static website. You can
see the status of that at my [Descent into Avernus](http://timsaucer.github.io/avernus) site.
