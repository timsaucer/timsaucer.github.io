Welcome, adventurer, to the land of Essirene.

## Overview

The world of Essirene has three large continents, Obbariel, Bidumar, and Istrediu. It is widely believed that many millennia ago these were all one great land mass, but a war among the Gods ended with breaking the world into three.

**Obbariel** is the largest land to the far west, ruled by a single empire of the same name. The people of Obbariel pride themselves on their ability to survive in any environs, and they have created great works to demonstrate their resolve. They have carved enormous cities out into the mountains, and equally impressive underground lands beneath the scorching dessert. It is said by the Obbareeze, as they call themselves, that a person who can survive in the West can survive any condition.

**Bidumar** is the other large land, governed by the Bidu to the North and the Marzen to the South. Though skirmishes sometimes break out along their border, the relative peace between the two allows for free trade among their people. The primary difference between the two is cultural. The Bidu have the an elected government ruled by the Five Protectors, whereas the Marzen maintain their matriarchy line of succession.

**Istrediu** is a much smaller land, situated in the temperate north with a sea border to both Obbariel and Bidumar. The Free People of Istrediu take pride in keeping individualism above all else. It is said that the only time you can ever get the Istrediu to agree on anything is by attempting to take control of them. As a relative neutral party, they are a common go-between for people wishing to trade between Obbariel and Bidu. The free spirit of the people and the excellent climate also make Istrediu the vacation destination of the extremely wealthy.
